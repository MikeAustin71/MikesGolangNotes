# Mike's Golang Notes

This E-Book provides information and sample source code for those learning or using the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/) (a.k.a. Golang).

## Free E-Book
This is E-Book is made available to the public, free of charge.

## Golang Information, Source Code And Hyperlinks to Videos & Articles
This E-Book contains 3,600+ pages of information and source code covering a wide range of Golang topics. In addition, there are hundreds of hyperlinks to videos, articles and other books focusing on specific Golang subjects.  

## Requirements: You will need a (free) E-Book Viewer
To view this E-Book you will need an e-book viewer. Popular options for a **free E-Book viewer** include [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html) and [Calibre E-book Manager](http://calibre-ebook.com/). 

Since this E-Book was developed with the Calibre system, the Calibre E-book Manager will provide a superior viewing experience. Plus, the Calibre viewer has the advantage of a 'back button' and 'forward button'.  Otherwise, the Adobe viewer is perfectly suitable for viewing this E-Book.

## E-Book Formats Compatible with Windows, Linux & Mac
Your choice of E-Book Reader will allow you to view this E-Book on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.

Two formats are provided for this E-Book: epub and mobi. 

The mobi format should be compatible with Kindle Readers, but I have not tested this.

The epub format is the most widely supported format and probably provides the best viewing experience. 
  
 ## To Download - Clone this Repository & load E-Book into an E-Book Viewer.
 
 You will need a copy of git to clone this repository.
 
 For an ideal configuration, I recommend you load the e-pub file contained in the repository into your E-Book Reader of Choice. 
    
 
 ## Golang ROCKS!!!
  
I hope this helps.
   
Thanks - Have Fun!

  #### Linux Installations
  
  2016-12-05 - Re: linux issues. Personally loaded .epub file under a clean installation of Ubuntu 16.04 and Calibre E-book manager. Seems to function as planned. Presentation looks great. Calibre linux installation is discussed [here](http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux).
  I used recommended Calibre installation command:
  ```
  sudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.py | sudo python -c "import sys; main=lambda:sys.stderr.write('Download failed\n'); exec(sys.stdin.read()); main()"
  ```
 Please let me know if you experience difficulties.
